##PENDING:

* Change Graph Lab for Trueno Lab.
* Add the delete button functionality.
* Add defiant JS Xpath filter, and add chips for each filter. Do the filter in a packed way so filters can be removed and graph can go back to previous state. Apply filter to visualization depending on the option(show on filter, hide, highlight)
* In the **inspect** section. Add the node traversal option. Example: when a node or edge is selected, you can click the start navigation. From here you can do steps of going out from this node to neighbors by applying filters. This is the drive mode.
* Add *pop-ups* for all Compute options. Create generic interface with the common input parameters, and the custom function for the results of each algorithm. Each result will be applied into the visualization in a different way. (this will be really time consuming).
* Add the Vertex and Edge Table Tab.
* Create the console tab where you can find query histories, results, and errors. This must persist in the browser cache.
* Add modal to the settings window.
* Add overall persistence layer to the client side.
